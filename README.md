# Banking Middleware Service

## Overview
This repository hosts the codebase for a **Middleware Service for Banking Applications**. This service acts as a bridge between various banking systems, providing integration, data transformation, and transaction routing to ensure seamless interoperability between legacy and modern banking infrastructures.

Built with **Java** and designed to meet banking-specific standards, this middleware solution aims to provide high availability, scalability, and security for financial transactions and data exchanges.

## Features
- **Transaction Processing**: Efficient and secure processing of various banking transactions.
- **Data Transformation**: Supports data transformation and mapping across multiple formats (e.g., JSON, ISO 8583).
- **API Management**: Provides RESTful and SOAP API endpoints for secure communication.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Ensures secure access through OAuth2, JWT, or other banking-grade security mechanisms.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrated with logging and monitoring tools for high visibility and transactional tracking.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with retries for failed transactions.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data
- **Protocols**: REST, ISO 8583
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes 
- **Other Tools**: OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation, Prometheus, and Grafana for monitoring
