## Overview
This Batavia repository hosts the codebase for a **Middleware Service for Banking Applications**. This service acts as a bridge between various banking systems, providing integration, data transformation, and transaction routing to ensure seamless interoperability between legacy and modern banking infrastructures.

Built with **Java** and designed to meet banking-specific standards, this middleware solution aims to provide high availability, scalability, and security for financial transactions and data exchanges.

## Features

- **Data Transformation**: Supports data transformation and mapping across multiple formats (e.g., JSON, ISO 8583).
- **API Management**: Provides RESTful and SOAP API endpoints for secure communication.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Ensures secure access through OAuth2, JWT, or other banking-grade security mechanisms.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrated with logging and monitoring tools for high visibility and transactional tracking.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with retries for failed transactions.
